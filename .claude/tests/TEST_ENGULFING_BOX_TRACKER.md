# Test Plan: Multi-Timeframe Engulfing Box Tracker

## Overview
Comprehensive testing strategy for the Pine Script that identifies engulfing candles across multiple timeframes and manages box lifecycles until price touches them.

## Core Functionality Tests

### 1. Engulfing Pattern Detection
**Test Scenarios:**
- [ ] Bullish engulfing pattern detection (bearish candle followed by bullish engulfing candle)
- [ ] Bearish engulfing pattern detection (bullish candle followed by bearish engulfing candle)
- [ ] Volume filter validation (pattern only triggers when volume > volume[1])
- [ ] Minimum engulfing percentage filter (configurable threshold)
- [ ] Trend filter using EMA (patterns align with trend direction)

**Expected Results:**
- Accurate detection of valid engulfing patterns
- Proper filtering based on user settings
- Visual confirmation with plotshape indicators

### 2. Multi-Timeframe Analysis
**Test Scenarios:**
- [ ] Pattern detection on TF1 (15min default)
- [ ] Pattern detection on TF2 (1H default)
- [ ] Pattern detection on TF3 (4H default)
- [ ] Pattern detection on TF4 (1D default)
- [ ] Simultaneous patterns across multiple timeframes
- [ ] Enable/disable individual timeframes

**Expected Results:**
- Non-repainting behavior with `lookahead=barmerge.lookahead_on`
- Proper timeframe-specific border colors
- Correct pattern detection across different timeframes

### 3. Box Lifecycle Management
**Test Scenarios:**
- [ ] Box creation on engulfing pattern detection
- [ ] Multiple active boxes from same timeframe
- [ ] Multiple active boxes from different timeframes
- [ ] Box extension until price touch
- [ ] State transition from ACTIVE to TOUCHED
- [ ] Visual color change when box is touched
- [ ] Box stops extending after touch

**Expected Results:**
- Each engulfing pattern creates a new box
- Boxes extend properly until touched
- State management works correctly for multiple concurrent boxes
- Visual feedback for box status changes

### 4. Price Touch Detection
**Test Scenarios:**
- [ ] Price touches box from above (high >= box_bottom)
- [ ] Price touches box from below (low <= box_top)
- [ ] Price fully inside box range
- [ ] Price gaps through box
- [ ] Multiple touches on same bar
- [ ] Intrabar touch scenarios

**Expected Results:**
- Accurate touch detection using `high >= box.get_bottom() and low <= box.get_top()`
- Immediate state change on first touch
- Box stops extending and changes color
- Touch label appears at touch point

## Performance Tests

### 1. Multiple Active Boxes
**Test Scenarios:**
- [ ] 50 active boxes simultaneously
- [ ] 100 active boxes simultaneously  
- [ ] 200 active boxes (maximum limit)
- [ ] Box creation rate under high volatility
- [ ] Memory usage with maximum boxes

**Expected Results:**
- Smooth performance up to 200 boxes
- No script timeouts or errors
- Efficient array operations

### 2. Multi-Timeframe Load
**Test Scenarios:**
- [ ] All 4 timeframes enabled simultaneously
- [ ] High-frequency pattern detection
- [ ] `request.security()` call optimization
- [ ] Real-time vs historical performance

**Expected Results:**
- Stay within 40 security call limit
- Consistent performance across timeframes
- No repainting or data issues

## User Interface Tests

### 1. Input Configuration
**Test Scenarios:**
- [ ] Timeframe selection and enable/disable toggles
- [ ] Pattern filter settings (volume, trend, percentage)
- [ ] Box appearance settings (colors, border width, extension)
- [ ] Label display options

**Expected Results:**
- All inputs work as expected
- Changes take effect immediately
- Logical input validation

### 2. Visual Elements
**Test Scenarios:**
- [ ] Box colors differentiate bullish/bearish patterns
- [ ] Timeframe-specific border colors
- [ ] Labels show correct timeframe and pattern type
- [ ] Touch indicators appear correctly
- [ ] Chart readability with multiple overlapping boxes

**Expected Results:**
- Clear visual distinction between elements
- Professional appearance
- No visual clutter or confusion

## Edge Case Tests

### 1. Market Conditions
**Test Scenarios:**
- [ ] Low liquidity periods
- [ ] High volatility periods
- [ ] Market gaps and weekend breaks
- [ ] Extended trending periods
- [ ] Consolidation periods

**Expected Results:**
- Robust performance across all market conditions
- Appropriate pattern filtering
- No false signals or errors

### 2. Timeframe Edge Cases
**Test Scenarios:**
- [ ] Chart timeframe higher than selected timeframes
- [ ] Invalid timeframe combinations
- [ ] Timezone changes
- [ ] Market session boundaries

**Expected Results:**
- Proper error handling
- Logical timeframe validation
- Consistent behavior across sessions

## Integration Tests

### 1. Alert System
**Test Scenarios:**
- [ ] Pattern detection alerts
- [ ] Box touch alerts (if implemented)
- [ ] Alert frequency and reliability
- [ ] Alert message content

**Expected Results:**
- Timely alert delivery
- Accurate alert content
- No duplicate or false alerts

### 2. Real-Time Performance
**Test Scenarios:**
- [ ] Live market testing
- [ ] Real-time pattern detection
- [ ] Box updates during live trading
- [ ] Performance during market hours

**Expected Results:**
- Consistent real-time performance
- Accurate live pattern detection
- Smooth box management
